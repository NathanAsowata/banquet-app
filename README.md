## Purpose of this project
My goal for this project is to demonstrate my React development skills.

## How I built this project
* I used a UI design I created on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/5895yc0eBRnEHSWlnovMcq/Banquet-App?node-id=0%3A1)
* I used data provided by [The MealDB.com](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)
* I used NextJS because it is server rendered making well suited for hiding api keys from the client side

## Why I built this project this way
* Using CSS modules helps me avoid namespace collision for CSS classes.
* My plan is to work professionally as a frontend developer and I realised that the ability to fetch data from a REST API is an important skill for frontend developers. That is why I used data from an existing API in this project.

## The tools I used in this project
* Figma
* React
* TypeScript
* Sass
* NextJS
* React Icons


## Getting Started
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
