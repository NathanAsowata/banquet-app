## How I worked on this project
My goal was to build a web app that requires data from an external REST API
* I built this app based on designs I created on Figma: [Link to the Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/5895yc0eBRnEHSWlnovMcq/Banquet-App?node-id=0%3A1)
* I used the REST API provided by [TheMealDB.com](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)

## How to navigate this project
* I used a UI design I created on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/5895yc0eBRnEHSWlnovMcq/Banquet-App?node-id=0%3A1)
* I used data provided by [The MealDB.com](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)
* I used NextJS because it is server rendered making well suited for hiding api keys from the client side

## Why I built this project this way
* Using CSS modules helps me avoid namespace collision for CSS classes.
* My plan is to work professionally as a frontend developer and I realised that the ability to fetch data from a REST API is an important skill for frontend developers. That is why I used data from an existing API in this project.

## If I had more time I would change this
* Figma
* React
* TypeScript
* Sass
* NextJS
* React Icons


## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
* `npm dev` - To start development server.
* `npm start` - To start the app in production mode.
* `npm test` - To run tests
